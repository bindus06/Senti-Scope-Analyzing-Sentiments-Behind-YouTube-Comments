# Senti-Scope-Analyzing-Sentiments-Behind-YouTube-Comments
This project extracts comments from YouTube videos and evaluates their sentiment to generate a positivity score (in percentage). It automates the process of gathering user feedback and analyzing public opinion by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Project Overview: 
Senti Scope is an advanced AI-driven solution designed to analyze and 
classify sentiments in YouTube comments using Natural Language 
Processing (NLP). The system identifies emotional tones (positive, 
negative, or neutral) and detects toxicity in comments. The goal of this 
project is to provide users with insights into the sentiments surrounding 
various videos and their public reception. 
By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, the project 
aims to contribute to improving online discussions and promoting safer, 
more respectful digital communities. 

Key Features: 
• Sentiment Classification: Identifies positive, negative, and neutral 
tones in comments. 
• Toxicity Detection: Detects harmful and offensive language. 
• Public Opinion Insights: Analyzes public feedback trends to gauge 
the reception of content.

Technologies Used: 
• Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NLP Libraries (NLTK, SpaCy), 
YouTube API.
